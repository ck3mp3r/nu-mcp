# nu-mcp: Model Context Protocol Server for Nushell

> A Rust-based MCP server that exposes Nushell as a scripting engine with an extensible tool system for building modular, language-agnostic development tools.

nu-mcp enables AI agents to execute Nushell commands and access a growing catalog of specialized tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Tools are implemented as modular Nushell scripts that can wrap CLI utilities (kubectl, argocd), APIs (weather, finance), or terminal multiplexers (tmux).

Key features:
- **Core Mode**: Execute arbitrary Nushell commands via `run_nushell` tool
- **Extension Mode**: Load tools from directories (kubernetes, argocd, weather, finance, tmux, context7)
- **Hybrid Mode**: Combine both core execution and extension tools
- **Security Sandbox**: Configurable directory restrictions for command execution
- **Nix Integration**: Reproducible builds with immutable tool packages
