Execute Nushell commands and return output.

IMPORTANT:
- ONLY use Nushell syntax (NOT bash/sh/zsh)
- If unfamiliar with Nushell, use Context7 to research syntax and commands
- Commands run in a sandbox directory
- Use RELATIVE paths only (./file.txt, subdir/file.txt, .)
- Absolute paths are BLOCKED (e.g., /etc/passwd, /tmp/file)
- Path traversal (..) is BLOCKED
